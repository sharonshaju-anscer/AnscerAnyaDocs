# Introduction

ANSCER FMS offers a range of capabilities you can access through the REST APIs. These REST APIs are designed in accordance with open API standards, which ensure that the platform's features can be integrated with other applications and systems. By utilizing these APIs, you can tap into the platform's capabilities through programmatic methods. Use the APIs to build custom integrations and workflows that leverage the power of the ANSCER.

## Paths

Every API's URI has the prefix of the version and the resource, such as: `/api/v1/...`

## Authentication

ANSCER FMS supports API key user authentication:

### API Key

ANSCER uses API keys to provide secure API authentication and authorization. This enables the usage of ANSCER APIs without requiring user credentials such as username and password. The API key must be present in individual API requests in order to authenticate and authorize the request. The API Key is passed as part of the HTTP request header and in the following format:

- Key: **x-auth-token**
- Value: API key copied after Login in the ANSCER platform. E.g. `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJfaWQiOiI2MzVhYzY0ZmZlYzBjMDUwNDM1NjIzZWUiLCJuYW1lIjoiQXNod2FuZWUgS3VtYXIgR3VwdGEiLCJlbWFpbCI6ImFzaHdhbmVlQGFuc2Nlci5jb20iLCJyb2xlIjoiZGV2ZWxvcGVyIiwiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTI5ODc2LCJleHAiOjE2OTc1MzQ2NzZ9.nmlheIA3JJm_rPy-GMlYLT94fDNWiIpJaRMlRWgZtgE`
